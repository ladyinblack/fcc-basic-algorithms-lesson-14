###[Where Do I Belong](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/where-do-i-belong)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
This can be a tricky problem to understand.  You need to find where in the array a number should be inserted by order, and return the index where it should go.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
The first thing to do is sort the array from lower to bigger, just to make the code easier.  This is where sort comes in, it needs a callback function so you have to create it.
### Hint 2
Once the array is sorted, then just check for the first number that is bigger and return the index.
### Hint 3
If there is no index for that number then you will have to deal with that case too.
